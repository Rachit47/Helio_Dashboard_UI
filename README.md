#### Developed a React-based Admin frontend UI app designed for effective management and visualization of business data. The app features a user-friendly navbar with sections for Dashboard, Users, Products, Orders, and Useful (stats). The Dashboard provides real-time analytics with a graphical representation of the last 6 months' income, along with widgets for total revenue, customer count, net earnings, and balance. Additionally, the stats section offers insights into product sales trends over the past 6 months. 
### Note: This implementation does not include database connectivity.
